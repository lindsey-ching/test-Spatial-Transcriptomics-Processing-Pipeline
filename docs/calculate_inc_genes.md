# Calculate Incongruous Genes per Cells
---

### Steps

Calculate incongruous pairs per cell and incongruous genes per cell.
Incongruous genes per cell is the percentage of gene pairs where 2 genes which are not typically found together, co-occur. Incongruous genes per cell compares the expression levels for each gene in an incongruous pair and calculates the perentage of the lower-expressed gene relative to the total number of genes expressed in each cell.
